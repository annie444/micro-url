      <p>
        MicroUrl is a simple, self-hosted URL shortener. Your data stays with
        you â€” no companies collecting it, no weird tracking. Since it's open
        source, you can see exactly what it's doing. You can even hook it up to
        any domain you like, so your links look just how you want them.
